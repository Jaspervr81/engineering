1. We write software for, and with, other people.
    1. Engineering is a social endeavor.
    2. Technology is simply a means to an end.
    3. All other principles flow from this.
2. We are always learning.
    1. Success is often a lucky accident and failure is inevitable. In both cases
       we make a point to study the outcomes and the actions that led to them.
3. Systems are emergent.
    1. For the properties we know we build in observability and introspection to
       ask the system questions.
    2. For everything else, we try to get comfortable with the reality that we
       cannot predict the future and adapt as changes present themselves.
4. Decision-making is as critical as the end result.
    1. Chosen languages, architectures, design patterns, vendors, and more are
       chosen for various reasons and applied for specific purposes.
    2. Leave yourself and other breadcrumbs that provide useful context on the
       what, why, how, and when of those decisions.
      1. Write design documents, RFCs, and conduct recorded (written, at least)
         architecture reviews. Write useful code comments. All of these are
         accessibility features.
5. Software is malleable and ephemeral; product is not.
    1. Availability and reliable functionality of features and APIs must persist.
       How that is delivered is free to change.
6. Proofs-of-concept are highly flammable.
    1. Be willing to burn them down and start again.
    2. On the other hand, they can unexpectedly light up and take off.
